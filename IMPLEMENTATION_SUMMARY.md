- `_extract_agent_response()` - Response parsing utility
- Execution timing and metadata collection
- Integrated error handling with coordinator notification

### ✅ 5. Enhanced Chat Endpoint (`main.py`)

**Major Enhancements:**
- Concurrent streaming and workflow execution
- Rich SSE event stream with 8 event types
- Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- Proper SSE headers for optimal performance
- Client disconnect detection and cleanup

**New Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/workflows/{workflow_id}` - Complete workflow data
- `GET /api/workflows/{workflow_id}/status` - Lightweight status check

### ✅ 6. Frontend Integration Support

**Complete Integration Guide:**
- TypeScript/JavaScript client implementation
- React component examples with reasoning display
- CSS styles for optimal UX
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Performance optimization guidelines

## Event Flow Architecture

```
User Request → Workflow Creation → Streaming Session Creation
                      ↓
              Agent Execution ← → Real-time Event Stream
                      ↓                    ↓
              Backend Persistence    Frontend Updates
                      ↓                    ↓
              Completion Event ← → Final Response Display

## Usage Examples

### Backend Implementation:
```python
# Enhanced streaming workflow execution
final_response = await execute_workflow_with_streaming(workflow_id, prompt)

# Real-time event coordination
async with streaming_session(workflow_id, prompt) as events:
    async for event in events:
        # Events automatically streamed to frontend
        pass
```

### Frontend Implementation:
```typescript
// Complete streaming client
const client = new CommunicationsAgentClient('/api');
const eventStream = await client.sendMessage('Find cases for John Smith');

for await (const event of eventStream) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'reasoning_step':
      displayReasoningStep(event);
      break;
    case 'workflow_completed':
      displayFinalResponse(event.final_response);
      break;
  }
}
```

### CURL Testing:
```bash
# Real-time streaming
curl -N -H "Accept: text/event-stream" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Find cases for John Smith"}' \
  http://localhost:8082/chat

# Fallback access
curl http://localhost:8082/api/workflows/wf_12345abc
```
